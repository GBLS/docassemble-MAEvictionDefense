  Hi! This is MADE (Massachusetts Defense against Eviction) from Greater Boston
  Legal Services.
  
  When you used our self-help eviction defense tool on ${interview_date}, you asked
  your landlord to send you information to be ready for your case.
  
  That information should have been sent to you no later than ${date_discovery_due}.
  
  To protect your right to information for your case,
  you need to send a "motion to compel discovery" to
  % if landlord.has_attorney:
    ${landlord.attorneys_name}
  % else:
    ${landlord.name}
  % endif
  . You also need to send a copy of the motion to ${court.name}.
