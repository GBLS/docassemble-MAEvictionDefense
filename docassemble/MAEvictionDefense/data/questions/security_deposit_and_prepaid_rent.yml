question: Prepaid last month's rent
subquestion: |
  "Last-month's rent" means the rent that some landlords take when you first move in as "first, last, and security deposit".
  It is rent that you paid in advance that can be applied for the month that you move out of the apartment.

  If your landlord took "last month's rent" they need to pay you interest on it once each year.

  Did your landlord violate the rules for handling your prepaid last month's rent? Check all that apply.
fields:
  - Did you pay pre-paid last month's rent when you first moved in to the apartment?: last_months_rent.prepaid
    datatype: yesno
