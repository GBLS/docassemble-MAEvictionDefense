    About this interview
  content: |
    This interview is meant to help Massachusetts residents respond to an eviction.

    There are 5 forms available in this interview:
    
    1. Answer (your response to the eviction)
    1. Request for Discovery (your chance to get information to be prepared for court)
    1. Late Answer request
    1. Transfer to Housing Court (if your case is not in a housing court, you can move it for free)
    1. Intervene (if you are not named in the eviction, you can ask for permission to defend against the eviction in court)
     
    At the end of this interview, you will have documents that you can file in court. 
    This interview does _not_ file them for you.
    You need to 
    give a copy of the documents to your landlord or your landlord's attorney.
