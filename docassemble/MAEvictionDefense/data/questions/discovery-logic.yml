question: |
  Discovery: Getting ready for court
subquestion: |
  This interview is set up to give you "discovery", or questions for your landlord.
  Do you want to select them on your own, or stick with the defaults?
    
  Because of the answers you've already given,
  you currently have **${ ints.count_checked() }** questions for your landlord, and 
  **${ drq.count_checked() }** kinds of documents that you are asking for.

  Most tenants don't need to make any changes here.

  You have the right to get information from your landlord, or "discovery". The information
  can help you prepare for court or reach a fair agreement with your landlord.
  
  Discovery is governed by [U.S.P.R. 7](https://www.mass.gov/trial-court-rules/uniform-summary-process-rule-7-discovery).
  
  This interview can help you both ask your landlord questions, and ask your landlord
  to give you copies of documents, like your lease or rent payment records. 
  You also have the right to ask the landlord for "admissions" (yes no questions)
  but this interview will not help you ask those.
  
  Your landlord will have 10 days to get the information to you. If they don't,
  you have the right to ask the judge to order them to give it to you.
  Part of the packet you deliver will include a motion form you can use to ask for
  discovery if your landlord doesn't give it to you.
