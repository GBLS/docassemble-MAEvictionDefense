  The Massachusetts Consumer Protection law, [G.L. c. 93A](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXV/Chapter93A),
  protects tenants from violations of local, state and federal law.
  It allows tenants who win their case to get attorneys' fees and extra damages (additional
  money if they win).
  
  Consumer protection applies to landlords who are "in the businsess" of being a landlord.
  It doesn't apply to a government agency, such as a housing authority, or to a 
  homeowner who rents out a room or second unit in a small building of less than 4 units.
