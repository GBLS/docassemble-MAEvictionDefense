section: About Your Tenancy
help: |
  Your tenancy situation and the type of agreement you have to live at your address
  may affect your rights. For example, a live in aide or caretaker is entitled
  to different notice rights than a tenant paying rent or an owner or former owner
  after foreclosure.

  There are three common kinds of *leases*:
  
  1. A "fixed term" lease states that it ends on a specific day, usually one year
  from the date it is signed. A tenant with a fixed term lease does not always get a notice to quit if the landlord
  does not renew the lease.
  2. A "self-extending" lease automatically gets renewed. Usually, the new term is the same as the original term.
  3. A special kind of self-extending lease automatically gets renewed but is no longer a lease. Instead it converts into
  a month-to-month tenancy, or tenancy at will.

  There are slightly different rules for tenants with a lease that is still in effect, versus a tenant-at-will. For example,
  you may get a different amount of time to come up-to-date with your rent.
  The default
  is that every tenant without a lease has the same rights as a tenant-at-will.
