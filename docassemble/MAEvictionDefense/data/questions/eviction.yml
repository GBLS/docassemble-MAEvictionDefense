question: |
  MADE: Massachusetts Defense for Eviction
subquestion: |
  MADE helps tenants defend against an eviction in court.
  We will create forms that you then need to :print: print and :envelope:
  deliver to court and to your landlord. It should take you about :stopwatch: 25 minutes to complete.
  If you get interrupted, you can save your work and come back to it. You can also
  email yourself the completed forms.
  This interview is completely free.
  
  Before we start, you should find:

  1. The **Summons and Complaint** and 
  2. the **Notice to Quit** you got from your landlord.
  
  If you don't have either document, you can still do your best to answer from your memory.
  
  At any time, click on a {green word} to learn what it means. Click the "[Help]" button to learn more
  about the interview or a specific question, and "[BACK]" if you want to go back
  to the previous question.

question: |
  Upcoming court dates
subquestion: |
  Do you have a court date coming up for your case?
field: case.status
choices: 
  - I have a notice from my landlord but I am not scheduled for court yet.: onlyntq
  - I have a court date scheduled: summons
  - I signed an agreement in this case already. I have a new court date coming up.: afj
  - I missed my first court date.: late
default: summons
help:
  We need to know how far along in the court process you are so we can choose the right forms.
  
  If your first court date has passed, you may be able to use a special form called a 
  "Motion to File Late Answer." This interview will help you decide. 
section: Getting Started

question: |
  Your right to a jury trial
subquestion: |
  Both you and your landlord have the right to have a jury instead of 
  a judge decide your case. This is *your* only chance to claim your
  right to a jury (unless you file a separate form before the answer date).

  There is a chance that the judge will ask you to pay rent, or ‘use and occupancy’ while you
  wait for a jury trial to be scheduled. If you do have a trial, a jury trial will be difficult
  to do on your own without a lawyer's help.

  #### Why claim your right to a jury trial?
  1. Members of the jury are your peers. Some may be tenants who can understand your experience.
  2. Jury trials take time to schedule. You can use this time to try to resolve your case.
  3. You can change your mind and decide later that you do not want a jury trial. 
  A jury trial also does not mean you lose the chance to negotiate an agreement.
  Most tenants, whether they requested a jury trial or not, end up reaching an agreement with their
  landlord and don't have a trial of any kind.

field: claim_jurytrial
buttons:
  - Claim a jury trial: True
  - Waive my right to a jury: False
section: Your Right to a Jury Trial
help: |
  In Massachusetts evictions, a jury may be either 6 or 12 people. At least 5/6 jurors
  must agree to reach a decision in your case. They will reach a separate decision
  about each of your claims and defenses, money owed to the landlord, and whether
  you get to remain in your apartment.

question: |
  Method of Service
subquestion: |
  A copy of the paperwork needs to go to your landlord. If your landlord has an attorney,
  you need to bring it to their attorney. The address is written on your Summons and
  Complaint.
  
  % if format_date(case.answer_date) == format_date(today()):
  You must deliver the paperwork in person today. You cannot mail it.
  % endif

  Some landlords or landlord's attorneys will allow you to deliver the paperwork
  by fax or email. However, you must call and confirm with your landlord before
  faxing or emailing. The landlord has to agree to get the paperwork this way.

  When and how will you bring the paperwork to your landlord or their attorney?
fields: 
  - Delivery method: method_of_service
    choices:
      - Mail: mailed
      - Delivering by hand: delivered in-hand
      - Email (with permission of my landlord): emailed

  Optional follow-up
subquestion: |
  We can send you a reminder :bell: when important
  dates in your court case are coming up. We would also like to send you a short
  survey after your court date. The survey will help us improve this service.
    
  If you don't want us to contact you again, remove the checkboxes below.
  
fields:
  - Remind me about upcoming deadlines. : remind_user
    datatype: yesno
    default: True
  - Send me a follow-up survey after my first court date.: survey_user

help: |
  If you agree, we can send you a reminder text message and email message when you
  have a deadline or need to appear in court. *The reminders will only be based on
  the information you gave us in this interview.* If your court date changes for
  any reason, keep in mind that the reminder might be for the wrong date. It's important
  that you still pay attention to the dates that the court tells you about.
  
  We can also save information about your case if you choose. Saved information
  will be used only by a non-profit legal aid organization. It may be used to help
  you if your case is accepted for full representation, or it may be used to identify
  trends to help the non-profit legal aid organization bettter decide how to use
  its resources to prevent evictions.
  
  Sharing your information is optional. You can use this service for free whether or not
  you want your information to be shared.
