question: |
  MADE: Massachusetts Defense for Eviction
subquestion: |
  MADE helps tenants defend against an eviction in court.
  We will create forms that you then need to :print: print and :envelope:
  deliver to court and to your landlord. It should take you between :stopwatch: 25 
  minutes and an hour to complete, depending on how complex your case is.
  If you get interrupted, you can save your work and come back to it. You can also
  email yourself the completed forms.
  This interview is completely free.
  
  Before we start, you should find:

  1. The **Summons and Complaint** and 
  2. the **Notice to Quit** you got from your landlord.
  
  If you don't have either document, you can still do your best to answer from your memory.
  
  At any time, click on a {green word} to learn what it means. Click the "[Help]" button to learn more
  about the interview or a specific question, and "[BACK]" if you want to go back
  to the previous question.

  How to answer questions in this interview
subquestion: |
  This interview asks for facts about you, your landlord, and your eviction case.
  The facts will be used to decide who should win your eviction case and whether
  you or landlord owes the other person any money.
  It's important to answer honestly.
  
  You should mark any facts that are true, even 
  if you do not think they are related to the eviction. _If you are not sure about a 
  question, usually it is better to mark it than to leave it blank._
    
  Using this interview will not stop you from reaching an agreement with your
  landlord. It may help you and your landlord better understand your rights
  and reach a fair agreement.

  Do you have a court date coming up for your case?

  - I signed an agreement in this case already. I have a new court date coming up.: afj
  - I missed my first court date.: late
default: summons
help:
  We need to know how far along in the court process you are so we can choose the right forms.
  
  If your first court date has passed, you may be able to use a special form called a 
  "Motion to File Late Answer." This interview will help you decide.

question: |
  Your right to a jury trial
subquestion: |
  You or your landlord can choose to have a jury
  decide this case. This is _your_ chance to choose a jury.
  
  Choosing a jury does not mean you will stop having to pay rent, or 'use and occupancy'.
  Jury trials are complicated and if you are unable to reach an agreement with your
  landlord, it helps most tenants to have a lawyer with them at a jury trial.
  
  #### Why keep your right to a jury trial?
  1. A jury is made up of ordinary people, some of whom may be tenants like you.
  1. It takes time to schedule a jury trial. You can use the time to try to solve the 
  problem with your landlord.
  1. You can always give up your jury right later. But you can't ask for a jury trial
  after the deadline for filing this paperwork.
  1. You can still reach an agreement with your landlord. Most cases end up with
  an agreement, whether the tenant keeps their right to a jury trial or not.

field: claim_jurytrial
buttons:
  - Keep my jury trial: True
  - Waive my right to a jury: False
section: Getting Started
decoration: users
help: |
  Either the landlord or the tenant can choose a jury trial any time up until the
  answer date which is printed on your Summons and Complaint. You can use this
  interview to ask for your jury trial, or another form, but it must be
  before the deadline. If you do think you may want a jury, you should keep your
  jury right in this interview.
  
  A jury trial can be difficult for a tenant to do on their own. However, because
  most cases end in an agreement, asking for a jury trial now has very low risk.
  
  If you do end up having a jury trial, in Massachusetts evictions, a jury may
  be either 6 or 12 people. At least 5/6 jurors
  must agree to reach a decision in your case. They will reach a separate decision
  about each of your claims and defenses, money owed to the landlord, and whether
  you get to remain in your apartment.

  Method of Service
subquestion: |
  A copy of the paperwork needs to go to your landlord. If your landlord has an attorney,
  you need to bring it to their attorney. The address is written on your Summons and
  Complaint.
  
  % if format_date(case.answer_date) == format_date(today()):
  You must deliver the paperwork in person today. You cannot mail it.

  Some landlords or landlord's attorneys will allow you to deliver the paperwork
  by fax or email. However, you must call and confirm with your landlord before
  faxing or emailing. The landlord has to agree to get the paperwork this way.

  When and how will you bring the paperwork to your landlord or their attorney?

  - Delivery method: method_of_service
    choices:

  If you agree, we can send you a reminder text message and email message when you
  have a deadline or need to appear in court. *The reminders will only be based on
  the information you gave us in this interview.* If your court date changes for
  any reason, keep in mind that the reminder might be for the wrong date. It's important
  that you still pay attention to the dates that the court tells you about.
  
  We can also save information about your case if you choose. Saved information
  will be used only by a non-profit legal aid organization. It may be used to help
  you if your case is accepted for full representation, or it may be used to identify
  trends to help the non-profit legal aid organization bettter decide how to use
  its resources to prevent evictions.
  
  Sharing your information is optional. You can use this service for free whether or not
  you want your information to be shared.
