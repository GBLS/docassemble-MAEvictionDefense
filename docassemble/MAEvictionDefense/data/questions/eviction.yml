  Massachusetts Eviction Defense

  Greater Boston Legal Services and other Massachusetts legal aid programs created this interview for tenants who are facing eviction. It will help you complete the forms that you must give your landlord and the court. It takes about :stopwatch: 25 minutes. And it is free. 
  
  You will receive documents that you can print and file at the end. When you complete the interview:
  
  1. You should  feel more confident about your legal rights and defenses.
  2. Your landlord may send you more information. You can use this to help you prepare for court.
  3. Your court appearance may be delayed by two weeks.

question: Getting Started
subquestion: |
   We will start with information in the documents you need:
   the Summary Process **Summons and Complaint** and the **Notice to Quit** you got.

question: |
  Upcoming court dates
subquestion: |
  This interview is designed to help a tenant whose case is scheduled in court for
  the first time. It can also help you ask for permission to file late.
  What best describes ${tenant.name}'s case?
field: case.status
choices: 
  - I have a notice from my landlord but I am not scheduled for court yet.: onlyntq
  - I have a court date scheduled: summons
  - I signed an agreement in this case already. I have a new court date coming up.: afj
  - I missed my first court date.: late
default: summons
help:
  We need to know how far along in the court process you are so we can choose the right forms.
  
  If your first court date has passed, you may be able to use a special form called a 
  "Motion to File Late Answer." This interview will help you decide.

question: |
  Your right to a jury trial
subquestion: |
  Both you and your landlord have the right to have a jury instead of 
  a judge decide your case. This is your only chance to claim your
  right to a jury (unless you file a separate form before the answer date).

  #### Why claim your right to a jury trial?
  1. Members of the jury are your peers. Some may be tenants who can understand your experience.
  2. Jury trials take time to schedule. You can use this time to try to resolve your case.
  3. You can change your mind and decide later that you do not want a jury trial. You can still negotiate an agreement with your landlord. A jury trial also does not mean you lose the chance to negotiate an agreement.

  
  There is a chance that the judge will ask you to pay rent, or ‘use and occupancy’ while you
  wait for the jury trial to be scheduled. Most tenants who get help from Greater Boston Legal Services clinics ask for a 
  jury trial.

  Method of Service
subquestion: |
  A copy of the paperwork needs to go to your landlord. If your landlord has an attorney,
  you need to bring it to their attorney. The address is written on your Summons and
  Complaint.
  
  % if format_date(case.answer_date) == format_date(today()):
  You must deliver the paperwork in person today. You cannot mail it.
  % endif

  Some landlords or landlord's attorneys will allow you to deliver the paperwork
  by fax or email. However, you must call and confirm with your landlord before
  faxing or emailing. The landlord has to agree to get the paperwork this way.

  When and how will you bring the paperwork to your landlord or their attorney?
fields: 
  - Delivery method: method_of_service
    choices:
      - Mail: mailed
      - Delivering by hand: delivered in-hand
      - Email (with permission of my landlord): emailed
      - Fax (with permission of my landlord): faxed
  - Date of delivery: service_date

  % if case.on_time :
  Please note: **your hearing date will be postponed to ${format_date(case.rescheduled_date)}**.
  You will not get any special notice in the mail. The new date is also printed
  on your paperwork.

  According to your earlier answer, you must deliver all copies no later than 
  **${format_date(case.answer_date)}**. Please note, most Massachusetts courts close at 
  4:30 PM.
  % else:
  Because you are filing your answer after the Answer date (${format_date(case.answer_date)}), the court will not postpone your hearing. You need to go to court as originally scheduled.
