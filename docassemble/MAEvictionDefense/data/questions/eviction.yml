comment: |
  This block controls the overall interview flow.
  interview-order.yml contains questions which set the logical order of the main Answer form
  which must be completed before discovery is generated.
  Then we load discovery defaults from a CSV file or Google Sheets.
  Finally, we display the final interview screens.
