question: |
  Massachusetts Eviction Defense
subquestion: |
  This guided interview will help you respond to an eviction in Massachusetts. It will also allow
  you to get information from your landlord to be better prepared for court. It should take you about 
  :stopwatch: 25 minutes to finish. And it is free. At the end of the interview, you will need to print 
  and deliver paperwork to the court and to your landlord or their attorney.

  Before we start, you should find:

  1. The **Summons and Complaint** and 
  2. the **Notice to Quit** you got from your landlord.
  
  If you don't have either document, you can still do your best to answer from your memory.
  
  At any time, click on a {green word} to learn what it means. Click the "[Help]" button to learn more
  about the interview or a specific question. You can also click "[< Back]" to go back and change your answers to a 
  question.

question: |
  Upcoming court dates
subquestion: |
  Do you have a court date coming up for your case?
field: case.status
choices: 
  - I have a notice from my landlord but I am not scheduled for court yet.: onlyntq
  - I have a court date scheduled: summons
  - I signed an agreement in this case already. I have a new court date coming up.: afj
  - I missed my first court date.: late
default: summons
help:
  We need to know how far along in the court process you are so we can choose the right forms.
  
  If your first court date has passed, you may be able to use a special form called a 
  "Motion to File Late Answer." This interview will help you decide. 
section: Getting Started

question: |
  Your right to a jury trial
subquestion: |
  Both you and your landlord have the right to have a jury instead of 
  a judge decide your case. This is *your* only chance to claim your
  right to a jury (unless you file a separate form before the answer date).

  There is a chance that the judge will ask you to pay rent, or ‘use and occupancy’ while you
  wait for a jury trial to be scheduled. If you do have a trial, a jury trial will be difficult
  to do on your own without a lawyer's help.

  #### Why claim your right to a jury trial?
  1. Members of the jury are your peers. Some may be tenants who can understand your experience.
  2. Jury trials take time to schedule. You can use this time to try to resolve your case.
  3. You can change your mind and decide later that you do not want a jury trial. 
  A jury trial also does not mean you lose the chance to negotiate an agreement.
  Most tenants, whether they requested a jury trial or not, end up reaching an agreement with their
  landlord and don't have a trial of any kind.

field: claim_jurytrial
buttons:
  - Claim a jury trial: True
  - Waive my right to a jury: False
section: Your Right to a Jury Trial
help: |
  In Massachusetts evictions, a jury may be either 6 or 12 people. At least 5/6 jurors
  must agree to reach a decision in your case. They will reach a separate decision
  about each of your claims and defenses, money owed to the landlord, and whether
  you get to remain in your apartment.

question: |
  Method of Service
subquestion: |
  A copy of the paperwork needs to go to your landlord. If your landlord has an attorney,
  you need to bring it to their attorney. The address is written on your Summons and
  Complaint.
  
  % if format_date(case.answer_date) == format_date(today()):
  You must deliver the paperwork in person today. You cannot mail it.
  % endif

  Some landlords or landlord's attorneys will allow you to deliver the paperwork
  by fax or email. However, you must call and confirm with your landlord before
  faxing or emailing. The landlord has to agree to get the paperwork this way.

  When and how will you bring the paperwork to your landlord or their attorney?
fields: 
  - Delivery method: method_of_service
    choices:
      - Mail: mailed
      - Delivering by hand: delivered in-hand
      - Email (with permission of my landlord): emailed
      - Fax (with permission of my landlord): faxed
  - Date of delivery: service_date

  Your documents are ready!
subquestion: |
  Please download and print 3 copies of each document below. 
  
  1. Bring one copy to the "Summary Process Clerk" at the ${ court.name }.
  2. Keep one copy for your personal records.
  % if landlord.has_attorney:
  3. Deliver the final copy to your landlord's attorney, ${landlord.attorneys_name}, at ${landlord.attorneys_address}.
  % else:
  3. Deliver the final copy to your landlord ${landlord.name}.
  %endif
  
  % if case.on_time :
  Please note: **your hearing date will be postponed to ${format_date(case.rescheduled_date)}**.
  You will not get any special notice in the mail. The new date is also printed
  on your paperwork.

  According to your earlier answer, you must deliver all copies no later than 
  **${format_date(case.answer_date)}**. Please note, most Massachusetts courts close at 
  4:30 PM.
  % else:
  Because you are filing your answer after the Answer date (${format_date(case.answer_date)}), 
  the court will not postpone your hearing. You need to go to court as originally scheduled.
