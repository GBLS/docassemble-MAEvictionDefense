  Court Date
subquestion: |
  To answer this question, please take a look at your Summons and Complaint. 
  Find the line that begins with NOTICE TO EACH DEFENDANT/TENANT.
  
  [FILE dates.png, 100%]
  
fields:
  - What is the date of your first court hearing?: case.original_date
    datatype: date
    hint: Often a Thursday.
  - What is the date it says the court must have your Answer? (This is usually a Monday): case.answer_date
    datatype: date
    hint: Usually a Monday
help:
  Trial dates are usually on a Thursday in many, but not all courts.
  
  This information helps us figure out if you are answering to the eviction by 
  the deadline. If you are filing your [Answer] on time, the court will delay your hearing by 2 weeks. It will also help us figure out when you need to go to court.

question: |
  Good news!
subquestion: |
  Because you will be filing these forms on-time (no later than ${format_date(case.answer_date)}), your case date will automatically be
  postponed by two weeks. You do not need to appear in court on ${format_date(case.original_date)}.
  
  Instead, you must appear on **${format_date(court_date)}**.

      code: |
        case_is_on_time = True  
help: |
  The two-week delay is automatic if a tenant files their response to the eviction
  on-time and requests discovery. See [U.S.P.R. 7(b)](https://www.mass.gov/trial-court-rules/uniform-summary-process-rule-7-discovery).

question: Reason for eviction
subquestion: |
  Look at your Notice to Quit. 
  
  What does your Notice to Quit say is the reason you are being evicted?
  
fields: 
  - Choose all reasons listed on your Notice to Quit that apply. : eviction_all_reasons
    datatype: checkboxes
    none of the above: False
    choices:
      - My landlord says I owe rent.: nonpayment
      - My landlord says I did something wrong other than owe rent. For example, a noise complaint or damage to the apartment.: fault  
      - My landlord does not want to rent to me any longer but it's not because of something I did. (For example, my landlord wants to rent to a family member.): nofault
      - I never got a Notice to Quit.: nontq
      - I don't know. : unsure
help: |
  Look carefully at your notice to quit or notice to terminate tenancy. Choose the 
  best answer you can from the information on the notice. There is no special
  language that your landlord must use when telling you the reason for the eviction.
  It can sometimes be written in a confusing or unclear way.
