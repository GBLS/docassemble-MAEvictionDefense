  Defenses for fault eviction
subquestion: |
  If your landlord says you did something wrong, you can argue 1 or more of these 3 things. You did not do whatever the landlord says you did or it did not happen, you were not breaking any rules in your lease, or you could not control a guest’s behavior **so you should not be held responsible**.  
fields:
  - I deny the landlord's allegation of ${fault_basis}. (My landlord is wrong): fault.did_not_occur
    datatype: yesno
    default: True
  - ${capitalize(fault_basis)} is not a violation of my lease.: fault.not_violation_of_agreement
    datatype: yesno
    default: True
  - The ${fault_basis} was the fault of a guest that I had no control over.: fault.no_control_of_guest

question: Reason for eviction
subquestion: |
  Look at your Notice to Quit. 
  
  What does your Notice to Quit say is the reason you are being evicted?
  
fields: 
  - Choose all reasons listed on your Notice to Quit that apply. : eviction_all_reasons
    datatype: checkboxes
    none of the above: False
    choices:
      - My landlord says I owe rent.: nonpayment
      - My landlord says I did something wrong other than owe rent. For example, a noise complaint or damage to the apartment.: fault  
      - My landlord does not want to rent to me any longer but it's not because of something I did. (For example, my landlord wants to rent to a family member.): nofault
      - I never got a Notice to Quit.: nontq
      - I don't know. : unsure
help: |
  Look carefully at your notice to quit or notice to terminate tenancy. Choose the 
  best answer you can from the information on the notice. There is no special
  language that your landlord must use when telling you the reason for the eviction.
  It can sometimes be written in a confusing or unclear way.
