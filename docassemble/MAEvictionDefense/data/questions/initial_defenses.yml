  Termination of tenancy
subquestion: |
  
  The first step in termination is a Notice to Quit, 
  (also called Notice to Terminate Tenancy). If your landlord
  did not do this properly, you may have a defense.
  We'll start by asking questions about what type of notice you received and the
  type of tenancy agreement you have.

fields:
  - The notice to quit has my name on it.: ntq_includes_tenant_name
    datatype: yesno
    default: True
  - The notice to quit includes the names of everyone who signed the lease.: ntq_includes_all_tenants
    datatype: yesno
    default: True
  - The notice to quit has my correct address.: ntq_includes_correct_address
    datatype: yesno
    default: True
  - My lease requires a 30-day notice even for non-payment of rent.: lease_requires_30_day_notice
    datatype: yesno
    default: False
  - The notice to quit leaves out language that is required by my lease, by law, or by the requirements of a subsidy program.: ntq_leaves_off_required_language
    datatype: yesno
    default: False
  - Type of termination notice: notice_type
    choices:
      - 14 day Notice to Quit: fourteen_day
      - 30 day Notice to Quit: thirty_day
      - 72 hour Notice to Quit: seventy_two_hour
      - Notice "until the end of the next rental period" or similar: rental_period
      - I never received a Notice to Quit: no_ntq
  - I was behind in rent at the time I received the 14-day notice.: behind_in_rent
    datatype: yesno
    show if: 
      variable: notice_type
      is: 'fourteen_day'
  - I never agreed to pay the amount of rent the landlord is charging me for on the 14-day notice: refused_rent_increase
    datatype: yesno

  - I paid or offered to pay the full amount of money owed.: attempted_cure

        defined(lease_type) and lease_type == 'fixed_term'
  - I paid rent after receiving the notice to quit.: paid_rent

help: |
  Before you can be evicted, you need fair notice of the reason for the eviction
  and a chance to fix the problem, if it can be fixed.
  
  Because of this, the reason listed on the court notice (Summons and Complaint) should
  be a close match to the notice to quit. It's common and acceptable for the language
  to be slightly different if it has the same basic meaning. Sometimes the court summons will only say "failure to vacate
  after a proper notice to quit". It's always OK for the summons and complaint to list
  rent even if rent was not the reason for the notice to quit. The rent amount
  is also likely to change and the summons may list rent due after the original notice.

  Cure of non-payment
subquestion: |
  You may have the right to stop the eviction if you paid all money that was owed at the time to the

  The proper time payment is due depends on whether you have a lease or a tenancy at will.

  - My rental agreement is: tenancy_type

      - A written lease (even if expired): lease
      - A month-to-month or week-to-week agreement (tenancy at will): taw
