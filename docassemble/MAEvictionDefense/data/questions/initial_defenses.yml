question: |
  Termination of tenancy
subquestion: |
    When a landlord wants to evict you, the first thing they must do is give you is some written notice
    that they plan to evict you. Usually this is called a "notice to quit" or "notice to terminate tenancy"
    but it could also be included in your lease. If your landlord did not give you the
    right kind of notice, you may have a defense to being evicted.

    Below are statements about the notice that you received. Select any that apply to you.
fields:
  - The notice to quit has my name on it.: ntq_includes_tenant_name
    datatype: yesnoradio
    default: True
  - The notice to quit includes the names of everyone who signed the lease.: ntq_includes_all_tenants
    datatype: yesnoradio
    default: True
  - The notice to quit has my correct address.: ntq_includes_correct_address
    datatype: yesnoradio
    default: True
  - My lease requires a 30-day notice even for non-payment of rent.: lease_requires_30_day_notice
    datatype: yesno
    default: False
  - The notice to quit leaves out language that is required by my lease, by law, or by the requirements of a subsidy program.: ntq_leaves_off_required_language
    datatype: yesno
    default: False

  Massachusetts has strict requirements for language in an eviction notice. Language might be required by
  Massachusetts law, your lease, or a federal rule if you are living in subsidized housing.

  If you are not a lawyer, it may be hard to figure out that certain language is required in your notice.
  You can learn more at
  [MassLegalHelp](http://www.masslegalhelp.org/housing/lt1-chapter-12-evictions.pdf)
  and if you aren't sure, you can probably talk to a lawyer at the Attorney for the Day table at your local court.

help: |
  Before you can be evicted, you need fair notice of the reason for the eviction
  and a chance to fix the problem, if it can be fixed.
  
  Because of this, the reason listed on the court notice (Summons and Complaint) should
  be a close match to the notice to quit. It's common and acceptable for the language
  to be slightly different if it has the same basic meaning. Sometimes the court summons will only say "failure to vacate
  after a proper notice to quit". It's always OK for the summons and complaint to list
  rent even if rent was not the reason for the notice to quit. The rent amount
  is also likely to change and the summons may list rent due after the original notice.
