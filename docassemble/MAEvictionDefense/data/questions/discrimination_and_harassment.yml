question: Protected classes and discrimination
subquestion: |
  Do you have any reason to believe that your landlord is discriminating against you?
  
  "Discrimination" means that your landlord is evicting you because of something about you
  or your family that is legally protected. Discrimination does not mean your landlord does not like you.

  Discrimination may include:

  * Not wanting to rent to children (maybe because of lead paint)
  * Not wanting to make changes to rules or the property to help a disabled tenant
  * Not wanting to accept a Section 8 voucher or other rental assistance

  If you are unsure, you can select "yes" and see more detailed questions on the next
  screen.
