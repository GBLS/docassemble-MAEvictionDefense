  Requesting Time to Move
subquestion: |
  Tell the judge if you need more time to move.
  
  The judge will consider what you have to say if you lose your case. You will
  also have a chance to explain more in court.

    What should I say?
  content: |
    If you want, you can explain to the judge why you need more time to move
    if you lose your case. You may automatically get more time if you have 
    a disability or if you are over the age of 60. But the judge decides.
    
    For example:
    
    1. You have a child who has an IEP in your local school.
    1. You have a custody arrangement that makes it hard to spend time with your
    children if you had to move.
    
    If you are over the age of 60 or if you have a disability, the judge can 
    give you up to 1 year. Otherwise, the judge can give you up to 6 months.

question: |
  How to answer questions in this interview
subquestion: |
  This interview asks for facts about you, your landlord, and your eviction case.
  Your answers to the questions will create a legal document that you will sign 
  and file with the court. Your answers will help the court get your side of the
  story.  Your answers also may show that your landlord does not have a case to
  evict you. So, be sure to answer every question fully and truthfully.
  
  You should mark any facts that are true, even 
  if you do not think they are related to the eviction. _If you are not sure about a 
  question, usually it is better to mark it than to leave it blank._
    
  Using this interview will not stop you from reaching an agreement with your
  landlord. It may help you and your landlord better understand your rights
  and reach a fair agreement.

id: jury trial
question: |
  Your right to a jury trial
subquestion: |
  Do you want a jury trial?
  
  You have a right to a jury trial and you must ask for it now.

  ### What is a jury trial? 

  * In a jury trial the jury decides who wins the case.
  * The other option is a trial with a judge and the judge decides who wins the case.
  * A jury is made up of ordinary people, some of whom may be tenants like you.
  * Jury trials are complicated and it helps to have a lawyer represent you in a jury trial.

  ### Should I keep my right to a jury trial?
  * You may have more time to find a lawyer if you ask for a jury trial.
  * You can always give up your jury right later. But you can't ask for a jury trial after the deadline for filing this paperwork.
  * You can still reach an agreement with your landlord. Most cases end up with an agreement, whether the tenant keeps their right to a jury trial or not.
  * Choosing a jury does not mean you will stop having to pay rent, or 'use and occupancy.'

  - Keep my jury trial: True
  - Give up my right to a jury: False
# section: Getting Started
decoration: users
help: |
  Either the landlord or the tenant can choose a jury trial any time up until the
  answer date which is printed on your Summons and Complaint. You can use this
  interview to ask for your jury trial, or another form, but it must be
  before the deadline. If you do think you may want a jury, you should keep your
  jury right in this interview.
  
  A jury trial can be difficult for a tenant to do on their own. However, because
  most cases end in an agreement, asking for a jury trial now has very low risk.
  
  If you do end up having a jury trial, in Massachusetts evictions, a jury may
  be either 6 or 12 people. At least 5/6 jurors
  must agree to reach a decision in your case. They will reach a separate decision
  about each of your claims and defenses, money owed to the landlord, and whether
  you get to remain in your apartment.

# section: About Your Tenancy
help: |
  Your tenancy situation and the type of agreement you have to live at your address
  may affect your rights. For example, a live in aide or caretaker is entitled
  to different notice rights than a tenant paying rent or an owner or former owner
  after foreclosure.

  There are three common kinds of *leases*:
  
  1. A "fixed term" lease states that it ends on a specific day, usually one year
  from the date it is signed. A tenant with a fixed term lease does not always get a notice to quit if the landlord
  does not renew the lease.
  2. A "self-extending" lease automatically gets renewed. Usually, the new term is the same as the original term.
  3. A special kind of self-extending lease automatically gets renewed but is no longer a lease. Instead it converts into
  a month-to-month tenancy, or tenancy at will.

  There are slightly different rules for tenants with a lease that is still in effect, versus a tenant-at-will. For example,
  you may get a different amount of time to come up-to-date with your rent.
  The default
  is that every tenant without a lease has the same rights as a tenant-at-will.

# section: About You
help: |
  Even in a simple case, your rights may depend on actions your landlord took or
  failed to take during the time that you lived in your home.
  If you owe any rent, your claims may reduce the amount of rent owed, or your
  landlord may end up owing you money. They may also give you the right to stay in
  your home.
  
  Read this list carefully and check any options that apply to you.

question: |
  Transfer to Housing Court
subquestion: |
  You said that your case is currently scheduled in ${court}.

  You have the right to transfer your case to ${local_housing_court}.
  Most tenants benefit from transferring their case to the Housing Court.
  Depending on your city or town, the housing court may be more difficult to get to.
  You should come up with a plan to get to court on time.

  Check the [Housing Court For All](http://www.housingcourt4all.org/where-the-housing-court-sits.html) website
  to learn where the ${local_housing_court} sits for your city or town.

  #### Why transfer your case to housing court? 
  1. Access to legal aid and [Lawyer for the Day](https://www.mass.gov/service-details/lawyer-for-the-day-programs) programs.
  2. Access to the [Tenancy Preservation Program](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/tenancy-preservation-program).
  3. Access to social service agencies that may help you pay back rent.
  4. Judges who specialize in housing law.

  Transferring your case may also postpone your first court hearing by a week or more, depending on your court.

  Defenses for your case

  The main reason your landlord says they are
  evicting you is '${eviction_detailed_reason}'.
  
  % if eviction_reason == "fault":
  That means you won't be allowed to counter-sue your landlord for money to win in this case.
  %if plead_counterclaims:
  Your landlord also says you owe money. You can still sue your landlord
  for money to offset (lower) the amount of rent owed.
  % endif  
  
  Your landlord must prove that '${eviction_detailed_reason}' is a good
  reason for evicting you. They also must prove that you did what they say you
  did.
  
  You may have other defenses that can stop the eviction. Common defenses include
  disability, mistakes by the landlord, and an eviction for a bad (illegal) reason.  
  
  % else:
  In a case like yours, you may win your case if you have at least one claim against your
  landlord. This is because of a law that protects tenants who withhold rent from a landlord
  who did not follow the law. For example, it can protect tenants from a landlord who did not
  repair bad housing conditions that they knew about before the tenant fell behind in the
  rent. It will be up to the judge or jury to decide if you qualify for this defense.
  % endif    
field: eviction_reason_explanation
help: |
  A very common defense in Massachusetts evictions is 
  [G.L. 239 s. 8A](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartIII/TitleIII/Chapter239/Section8A).
  It gives a tenant a defense to the eviction in any case brought "without fault"
  of the tenant, or if the case is brought for "non-payment of rent".
  
  If the tenant in a non-fault or non-payment case can prove at least $1 in damages, 
  they have 7 days from the date of the
  trial to pay any balance that is still owed to the landlord and they get to stay
  in the apartment. 
  Tenants are also protected against a landlord who retaliates against them for winning a case.
  In practice, this often means that the landlord will not be able
  to file a new eviction case for 6 months, but it is not guaranteed.
  
  This defense does _not_ apply if the eviction is brought "with fault" of the tenant.
  For example, you can't use this defense if the landlord says you broke your lease.

      Answering this question probably requires the help of a lawyer. You can leave it blank if you
      are not sure.
help:
  The Notice to Quit is the first step a landlord must take if they want to evict you.
  There is no standard form for a notice to quit, but it should include certain information.
  Also, depending on what kind of tenant you are, they may need to give you a specific amount of
  time in the notice.

  Massachusetts has strict requirements for language in an eviction notice. Language might be required by
  Massachusetts law, your lease, or a federal rule if you are living in subsidized housing.

  If you are not a lawyer, it may be hard to figure out that certain language is required in your notice.
  You can learn more at
  [MassLegalHelp](http://www.masslegalhelp.org/housing/lt1-chapter-12-evictions.pdf)
  and if you aren't sure, you can probably talk to a lawyer at the Attorney for the Day table at your local court.

    datatype: yesnoradio
    default: True
    show if: post_ntq_waiver['rent']
help: |
  "Waiver" is the idea that your landlord cannot evict you when they are acting in a way that means that they want you
  to continue as a tenant. The most straightforward type of waiver is when your landlord asks you to sign a new lease.
  However: even signing a new lease may not be waiver, if there is specific language in the lease that says the new lease
  will not waive the past eviction.

  The same idea is true if your landlord accepts rent from you after the eviction starts. However, it is very simple for
  your landlord to avoid "waiving" your tenancy if they include the "magic words" "rent will be accepted for use and occupancy only"
  either in the notice to quit or in a written notice when they accept your check for rent.

  There is a brief discussion of waiver in [Legal Tactics, Chapter 12](https://www.masslegalhelp.org/housing/lt1-chapter-12-evictions.pdf).

    datatype: yesnoradio
    default: True
  - The summons and complaint has my correct address.: summons_includes_correct_address
    datatype: yesnoradio
    default: True
    
help: |
  Before you can be evicted, you need fair notice of the reason for the eviction
  and a chance to fix the problem, if it can be fixed.
  
  The Summons and Complaint should be specific, but sometimes it will only say 
  something like "Failure to vacate after a valid notice". It's important that it
  not add something completely new that the tenant had no notice of.
  
  Because of this, the reason listed on the court notice (Summons and Complaint) should
  be a close match to the notice to quit. It's common and acceptable for the language
  to be slightly different if it has the same basic meaning. Sometimes the court summons will only say "failure to vacate
  after a proper notice to quit". It's always OK for the summons and complaint to list
  rent even if rent was not the reason for the notice to quit. The rent amount
  is also likely to change and the summons may list rent due after the original notice.

    show if: paid_rent_owed
help:
  Paying all rent owed is called "curing" the non-payment of rent and can stop the
  eviction. The deadline for paying the full amount of rent owed should be 
  listed on your notice to quit, but this interview will also help you determine what
  the deadline is. You only have the cure right if you haven't used it to stop an
  eviction in the last 12 months.
  
  If you have a lease you may still be able to cure the non-payment of rent.
  If you haven't made any payment yet, payment will likely need to include the costs
  of bringing you to court and serving you notices, about $180-$200, depending on the
  court.

  You may have a claim against your landlord for problems in your home over the last
  6 years, whether they are currently repaired or not. For certain problems, you may only
  have a claim for the last 4 years.
  
  If this is a no-fault or nonpayment of rent case, having bad conditions may stop
  the eviction (be a defense).
  
  Your landlord may also have to pay you the difference between the value of your home in full
  repair and the value of your home with the bad conditions for each month that you
  had bad conditions. For very serious problems
  that made the apartment unlivable, you may be entitled to 1 to 3 months of rent.

  Discrimination

id: discrimination splash
question: Protected classes and discrimination
subquestion: |
  Do you have any reason to believe that your landlord is discriminating against you?
  
  "Discrimination" means that your landlord is evicting you or otherwise treating you unfairly
  because of something about you
  or your family that is legally protected. Discrimination does not mean your landlord does not like you.

  Discrimination may include:

  * Not wanting to rent to children (maybe because of lead paint)
  * Not wanting to make changes to rules or the property to help a tenant with a disability
  * Not wanting to accept a Section 8 voucher or other rental assistance
  * Treating someone unfairly because of race, sex, religion, veteran status, or gender or sexuality

  If you are unsure, you can select "yes" and see more detailed questions on the next

  The Massachusetts Consumer Protection law, [G.L. c. 93A](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXV/Chapter93A),
  protects tenants from violations of local, state and federal law.
  It allows tenants who win their case to get attorneys' fees and extra damages (additional
  money if they win).
  
  Consumer protection applies to landlords who are "in the business" of being a landlord.
  It doesn't apply to a government agency, such as a housing authority, or to a 
  homeowner who rents out a room or second unit in a small building of less than 4 units.

    1. Interpreter notice (if you do not speak English, you have the right to an interpreter)
     
    At the end of this interview, you will have documents that you can file in court. 
    This interview does _not_ file them for you.
    You need to 
    give a copy of the documents to your landlord or your landlord's attorney.

    _sample only: your notice may look different_
  summons and complaint: |
    A written notice about your eviction case that tells you to go to court
    on a certain date.
    [FILE summons_and_complaint.png, 100%]
  summary process: |
    Summary process is the legal term for evictions in Massachusetts.
  plaintiff: |
    The person who starts a case. In an eviction, this is normally the landlord.
  defendant: |
    The person who is on the defensive in a case.  In an eviction, this is normally the tenant.
  tenancy at will: |
    An agreement to rent an apartment or house from month-to-month. It automatically 
    renews unless it is ended by a written notice.
    
    A tenancy by lease can convert into a tenancy at will when the lease has ended.
  subsidized tenancy: |
    A tenancy where the tenant pays something less than market rent, and a housing
    authority or HUD pays the difference. Often the tenant's rent is fixed at 30 or 40% of
    their income.
  G.L. c. 93A: |
    Referred to as the Consumer Protection Act. Enables legal action against unfair or deceptive conduct in the marketplace
  demand letter: |
    Under the consumer protection law, G.L. c. 93A, a consumer (or tenant) may send a
    "demand letter" explaining what the seller (or landlord) did wrong and requesting payment. 
    If the landlord fails to respond with a reasonable settlement offer, it may be liable for double
    or triple damages.
  disabled: |
    Legally, a person who is limited in one more areas of essential life activities.
    A disability may be physical or mental.
  reasonable accommodation: |
    A change in a landlord's rules, policies, or practices that would allow the tenant to 
    remain in the leased apartment. A tenant who is disabled and whose disability is
    related to the basis for the eviction may be legally entitled to such a change.
  protected class: |
    Protected class is a legal term to describe persons who are protected from discrimination.
    For example, you are protected from discrimination on account of (but not limited to) 
    race, gender, family status (having children), disability, and gender identity or 
    sexual orientation.
  use and occupancy: |
    The special legal name for **rent** due to the landlord after the landlord starts the
    eviction process.
  docket number: |
    The Docket Number is the number the court has assigned to your case. Sometimes it has not yet been assigned to your case, so it will not be on the Summons and Complaint. You may ask the court for this number, or leave it blank

  It looks like you may qualify for free legal help
subquestion: |
  Because of where you live, you may qualify for free legal help from
  [Greater Boston Legal Services](https://www.gbls.org).

  GBLS income guidelines may change over time. [View current guidelines](https://www.gbls.org/get-legal-help/towns-served).

  Eligibility depends on your income, household size, and where you live.

  Not everyone who qualifies will be assigned an attorney. Because of funding, GBLS can only represent about
  1 in 3 tenants who qualify for our help.

id: intake dont qualify
question: |
  Pre-screening
subquestion: |
  Based on your answers, you probably don't qualify for a free attorney from 
  [Greater Boston Legal Services](https://www.gbls.org). If you would like to 
  know if you qualify for help from a different program, please use the 
  [Legal Resource Finder](https://www.masslegalservices.org/FindLegalAid).

  You can open this link now but don't forget to come back and finish
  the interview.
help: |
  You told us that your household size is ${household_size + 1} and your income is about ${currency(household_monthly_income*12)}/year.

  GBLS can accept clients earning up to ${poverty_multiplier * 100}% of the current Federal Poverty Level. We think that is ${currency(household_income_limit)}/year
  for your household.

  Based on the ${poverty_level_update} Federal Poverty Guidelines, it looks like your income is too high. Please take a look at
  [GBLS's eligibility guidelines](https://www.gbls.org/get-legal-help/towns-served) and the 
  [Health and Human Services website](https://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty-guidelines) for up-to-date
  information. If this looks wrong or out of date, please email [MADE@gbls.org](mailto:made@gbls.org) so we can fix this.
