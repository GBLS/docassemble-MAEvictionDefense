question: |
  Requesting Time to Move
subquestion: |
  We don't know yet who will win your case. If your case goes to a trial, the judge or jury can decide in favor
  of you or your landlord.

  If the judge does decide that your landlord has the right to the apartment, the judge can give you more time to move.
  The judge will likely expect that you continue to pay rent while you stay in the apartment.
  
  The judge will consider your disability and whether anyone who lives with you is over the age of 60.
  Use your own words to explain any special circumstances about _your_ situation and why you need more time than
  a typical tenant. For example, if you need more time to find an accessible apartment or if your child has an IEP 
  in the local school district.

  How to answer questions in this interview
subquestion: |
  This interview asks for facts about you, your landlord, and your eviction case.
  The facts will be used to decide who should win your eviction case and whether
  you or your landlord owes the other person any money.
  It's important to answer honestly.
  
  You should mark any facts that are true, even 
  if you do not think they are related to the eviction. _If you are not sure about a 
  question, usually it is better to mark it than to leave it blank._
    
  Using this interview will not stop you from reaching an agreement with your
  landlord. It may help you and your landlord better understand your rights
  and reach a fair agreement.

question: |
  Your right to a jury trial
subquestion: |
  You or your landlord can choose to have a jury
  decide this case. This is _your_ chance to choose a jury.
  
  Choosing a jury does not mean you will stop having to pay rent, or 'use and occupancy'.
  Jury trials are complicated and if you are unable to reach an agreement with your
  landlord, it helps most tenants to have a lawyer with them at a jury trial.
  
  #### Why keep your right to a jury trial?
  1. A jury is made up of ordinary people, some of whom may be tenants like you.
  1. You may have more time to find a lawyer to represent you if you ask for a jury trial.
  1. You can always give up your jury right later. But you can't ask for a jury trial
  after the deadline for filing this paperwork.
  1. You can still reach an agreement with your landlord. Most cases end up with
  an agreement, whether the tenant keeps their right to a jury trial or not.

field: claim_jurytrial
buttons:
  - Keep my jury trial: True
  - Waive my right to a jury: False
section: Getting Started
decoration: users
help: |
  Either the landlord or the tenant can choose a jury trial any time up until the
  answer date which is printed on your Summons and Complaint. You can use this
  interview to ask for your jury trial, or another form, but it must be
  before the deadline. If you do think you may want a jury, you should keep your
  jury right in this interview.
  
  A jury trial can be difficult for a tenant to do on their own. However, because
  most cases end in an agreement, asking for a jury trial now has very low risk.
  
  If you do end up having a jury trial, in Massachusetts evictions, a jury may
  be either 6 or 12 people. At least 5/6 jurors
  must agree to reach a decision in your case. They will reach a separate decision
  about each of your claims and defenses, money owed to the landlord, and whether
  you get to remain in your apartment.

section: About Your Tenancy
help: |
  Your tenancy situation and the type of agreement you have to live at your address
  may affect your rights. For example, a live in aide or caretaker is entitled
  to different notice rights than a tenant paying rent or an owner or former owner
  after foreclosure.

  There are three common kinds of *leases*:
  
  1. A "fixed term" lease states that it ends on a specific day, usually one year
  from the date it is signed. A tenant with a fixed term lease does not always get a notice to quit if the landlord
  does not renew the lease.
  2. A "self-extending" lease automatically gets renewed. Usually, the new term is the same as the original term.
  3. A special kind of self-extending lease automatically gets renewed but is no longer a lease. Instead it converts into
  a month-to-month tenancy, or tenancy at will.

  There are slightly different rules for tenants with a lease that is still in effect, versus a tenant-at-will. For example,
  you may get a different amount of time to come up-to-date with your rent.
  The default
  is that every tenant without a lease has the same rights as a tenant-at-will.

  Even in a simple case, your rights may depend on actions your landlord took or
  failed to take during the time that you lived in your home.
  If you owe any rent, your claims may reduce the amount of rent owed, or your
  landlord may end up owing you money. They may also give you the right to stay in
  your home.
  
  Read this list carefully and check any options that apply to you.

question: |
  Transfer to Housing Court
subquestion: |
  You said that your case is currently scheduled in ${court.name}.

  You have the right to transfer your case to ${local_housing_court}.
  Most tenants benefit from transferring their case to the Housing Court.
  Depending on your city or town, the housing court may be more difficult to get to.
  You should come up with a plan to get to court on time.

  Check the [Housing Court For All](http://www.housingcourt4all.org/where-the-housing-court-sits.html) website
  to learn where the ${local_housing_court} sits for your city or town.

  #### Why transfer your case to housing court? 
  1. Access to legal aid and [Lawyer for the Day](https://www.mass.gov/service-details/lawyer-for-the-day-programs) programs.
  2. Access to the [Tenancy Preservation Program](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/tenancy-preservation-program).
  3. Access to social service agencies that may help you pay back rent.
  4. Judges who specialize in housing law.

  Transferring your case may also postpone your first court hearing by a week or more, depending on your court.

help: |
  A very common defense in Massachusetts evictions is 
  [G.L. 239 s. 8A](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartIII/TitleIII/Chapter239/Section8A).
  It gives a tenant a defense to the eviction in any case brought "without fault"
  of the tenant, or if the case is brought for "non-payment of rent".
  
  If the tenant in a non-fault or non-payment case can prove at least $1 in damages, 
  they have 7 days from the date of the
  trial to pay any balance that is still owed to the landlord and they get to stay
  in the apartment. In practice, this often means that the landlord will not be able
  to file a new eviction case for 6 months, but it is not guaranteed.
  
  This defense does _not_ apply if the eviction is brought "with fault" of the tenant.
  For example, you can't use this defense if the landlord says you broke your lease.

      Answering this question probably requires the help of a lawyer. You can leave it blank if you
      are not sure.
help:
  The Notice to Quit is the first step a landlord must take if they want to evict you.
  There is no standard form for a notice to quit, but it should include certain information.
  Also, depending on what kind of tenant you are, they may need to give you a specific amount of
  time in the notice.

  Massachusetts has strict requirements for language in an eviction notice. Language might be required by
  Massachusetts law, your lease, or a federal rule if you are living in subsidized housing.

  If you are not a lawyer, it may be hard to figure out that certain language is required in your notice.
  You can learn more at
  [MassLegalHelp](http://www.masslegalhelp.org/housing/lt1-chapter-12-evictions.pdf)
  and if you aren't sure, you can probably talk to a lawyer at the Attorney for the Day table at your local court.

help: |
  "Waiver" is the idea that your landlord cannot evict you when they are acting in a way that means that they want you
  to continue as a tenant. The most straightforward type of waiver is when your landlord asks you to sign a new lease.
  However: even signing a new lease may not be waiver, if there is specific language in the lease that says the new lease
  will not waive the past eviction.

  The same idea is true if your landlord accepts rent from you after the eviction starts. However, it is very simple for
  your landlord to avoid "waiving" your tenancy if they include the "magic words" "rent will be accepted for use and occupancy only"
  either in the notice to quit or in a written notice when they accept your check for rent.

  There is a brief discussion of waiver in [Legal Tactics, Chapter 12](https://www.masslegalhelp.org/housing/lt1-chapter-12-evictions.pdf).

help: |
  Before you can be evicted, you need fair notice of the reason for the eviction
  and a chance to fix the problem, if it can be fixed.
  
  The Summons and Complaint should be specific, but sometimes it will only say 
  something like "Failure to vacate after a valid notice". It's important that it
  not add something completely new that the tenant had no notice of.
  
  Because of this, the reason listed on the court notice (Summons and Complaint) should
  be a close match to the notice to quit. It's common and acceptable for the language
  to be slightly different if it has the same basic meaning. Sometimes the court summons will only say "failure to vacate
  after a proper notice to quit". It's always OK for the summons and complaint to list
  rent even if rent was not the reason for the notice to quit. The rent amount
  is also likely to change and the summons may list rent due after the original notice.

  Paying all rent owed is called "curing" the non-payment of rent and can stop the
  eviction. The deadline for paying the full amount of rent owed should be 
  listed on your notice to quit, but this interview will also help you determine what
  the deadline is. You only have the cure right if you haven't used it to stop an
  eviction in the last 12 months.
  
  If you have a lease you may still be able to cure the non-payment of rent.
  If you haven't made any payment yet, payment will likely need to include the costs
  of bringing you to court and serving you notices, about $180-$200, depending on the
  court.

  You may have a claim against your landlord for problems in your home over the last
  6 years, whether they are currently repaired or not. For certain problems, you may only
  have a claim for the last 4 years.
  
  If this is a no-fault or nonpayment of rent case, having bad conditions may stop
  the eviction (be a defense).
  
  Your landlord may also have to pay you the difference between the value of your home in full
  repair and the value of your home with the bad conditions for each month that you
  had bad conditions. For very serious problems
  that made the apartment unlivable, you may be entitled to 1 to 3 months of rent.

  Discrimination

question: Protected classes and discrimination
subquestion: |
  Do you have any reason to believe that your landlord is discriminating against you?
  
  "Discrimination" means that your landlord is evicting you or otherwise treating you unfairly
  because of something about you
  or your family that is legally protected. Discrimination does not mean your landlord does not like you.

  Discrimination may include:

  * Not wanting to rent to children (maybe because of lead paint)
  * Not wanting to make changes to rules or the property to help a disabled tenant
  * Not wanting to accept a Section 8 voucher or other rental assistance
  * Treating someone unfairly because of race, sex, religion, veteran status, or gender or sexuality

  If you are unsure, you can select "yes" and see more detailed questions on the next

  The Massachusetts Consumer Protection law, [G.L. c. 93A](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXV/Chapter93A),
  protects tenants from violations of local, state and federal law.
  It allows tenants who win their case to get attorneys' fees and extra damages (additional
  money if they win).
  
  Consumer protection applies to landlords who are "in the business" of being a landlord.
  It doesn't apply to a government agency, such as a housing authority, or to a 
  homeowner who rents out a room or second unit in a small building of less than 4 units.

  You have the right to get information from your landlord, or "discovery". The information

  Discovery is governed by [U.S.P.R. 7](https://www.mass.gov/trial-court-rules/uniform-summary-process-rule-7-discovery).
  
  This interview can help you both ask your landlord questions, and ask your landlord
  to give you copies of documents, like your lease or rent payment records. 
  You also have the right to ask the landlord for "admissions" (yes no questions)
  but this interview will not help you ask those.
  
  Your landlord will have 10 days to get the information to you. If they don't,
  you have the right to ask the judge to order them to give it to you.
  Part of the packet you deliver will include a motion form you can use to ask for
  discovery if your landlord doesn't give it to you.
